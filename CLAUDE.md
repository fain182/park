# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

Park is a PHP architecture validation tool that enforces architectural rules in PHP projects. It analyzes codebases using AST parsing to detect dependency violations and ensures modules follow defined architectural boundaries.

## Development Commands

```bash
# Run all tests
composer test
vendor/bin/phpunit

# Run specific test
vendor/bin/phpunit tests/EndToEnd/ExceptionsTest.php
vendor/bin/phpunit tests/Unit/Analyzer/AstCodeAnalyzerTest.php

# Static analysis
composer analyse
vendor/bin/phpstan

# Combined check (tests + analysis)
composer check

# Run the tool locally
./bin/park validate src
./bin/park validate tests/EndToEnd/fixtures/shouldNotDependOn

# Compare violations with base branch (useful for CI/PR validation)
./bin/park diff src                    # Compare with main branch
./bin/park diff --base=develop         # Compare with develop branch
./bin/park diff --base=main tests/     # Compare specific directory
```

## Core Architecture

### Analysis Pipeline
1. **FileScanner** discovers PHP files in target directory
2. **CodeAnalyzer** (AST-based) extracts dependencies from each file
3. **RuleValidator** validates dependency graph against configured rules
4. **ValidateCommand** formats output and returns appropriate exit codes

### Key Components

- **Rule System**: Fluent API for defining architectural constraints (`Rule::module()->shouldNotDependOn()`)
- **AST Analysis**: Uses `nikic/php-parser` to accurately detect dependencies (use statements, type hints, inheritance, etc.)
- **Exception Handling**: Supports exact class matches and namespace patterns (`App\Legacy`)
- **Validation Engine**: Centralized logic in `RuleValidator` with method-specific validators

### Directory Structure
```
src/Park/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Application.php           # Symfony Console app setup
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Rule.php                 # Fluent rule builder
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Command/ValidateCommand.php
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Analyzer/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ CodeAnalyzerInterface.php
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ AstCodeAnalyzer.php   # Primary AST-based analyzer
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ RegexCodeAnalyzer.php # Fallback regex analyzer
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Scanner/FileScanner.php   # File discovery
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Validator/RuleValidator.php # Core validation logic
```

## Testing Strategy

- **End-to-End Tests**: Test complete CLI workflow with realistic fixtures
- **Unit Tests**: Focus on `AstCodeAnalyzer` demonstrating AST advantages over regex
- **Test Fixtures**: Located in `tests/EndToEnd/fixtures/` with both positive and negative cases
- Each rule type has dedicated test files with success/violation scenarios

## Configuration

Rules are defined in `park.config.php`:
```php
return [
    Rule::module('App\Domain')
        ->except('App\Domain\Legacy')
        ->shouldNotDependOn('App\Infrastructure'),
];
```

## Implementation Notes

### AST vs Regex Analysis
- **AstCodeAnalyzer** (preferred): Accurate, ignores comments/strings, handles complex PHP constructs
- **RegexCodeAnalyzer** (legacy): Simple but prone to false positives

### Exception Pattern Matching
The `isException()` method in `RuleValidator` handles:
- Exact matches: `App\Domain\User` (matches only that specific class)
- Namespace patterns: `App\Domain\Legacy` (matches `App\Domain\Legacy` and all classes starting with `App\Domain\Legacy\`)

### Dependency Detection
AST analyzer detects dependencies through:
- Use statements, type hints, return types
- Class inheritance (`extends`, `implements`)
- Exception handling, `instanceof` checks
- Static calls and class constants

## Common Tasks

### Adding New Rule Types
1. Add method to `Rule.php` builder
2. Update `RuleValidator::validateRule()` switch statement
3. Implement validation method in `RuleValidator`
4. Add end-to-end tests with fixtures

### Debugging Analysis Issues
- Check `AstCodeAnalyzer` unit tests for expected behavior
- Use end-to-end test fixtures to reproduce issues
- Compare AST vs regex analyzer results in problematic cases

### Testing Changes
Always run the full test suite before commits. The project has 26 tests with 76 assertions covering all major functionality and edge cases.

## Gradual Enforcement

### Diff Command
The `diff` command enables gradual enforcement by comparing violations between branches, making it ideal for CI/PR validation on existing codebases with legacy violations.

**Usage:**
```bash
./bin/park diff [directory] [--base=branch]
```

**How it works:**
1. Analyzes violations in current working directory
2. Switches to base branch and analyzes violations there  
3. Compares the two sets and shows differences
4. Returns success (0) if no new violations, failure (1) if new violations found

**Output format:**
```
üìä Violation Diff vs main branch

‚ûï New violations (2):
  src/Domain/User.php ‚Üí App\Domain\User depends on App\Infrastructure\Database
  src/Service/Email.php ‚Üí App\Service\Email depends on App\Infrastructure\Queue

‚ûñ Fixed violations (1):
  src/Domain/Order.php ‚Üí App\Domain\Order depends on App\Infrastructure\Logger

‚ö†Ô∏è  CI Status: FAILED (new violations detected)
```

**CI Integration:**
Perfect for GitHub Actions/CI where you want to block PRs that introduce new violations while allowing existing technical debt to be addressed gradually.

**Git Safety:**
The command safely stashes uncommitted changes, switches branches for analysis, then restores the original state automatically.
